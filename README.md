### Hello Everyone!!!! 👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋

I am Edu, and I work in [PlainConcepts](https://www.plainconcepts.com/) doing stuff with computers!

In my spare time I love to contribute to OSS. Besides my contributions with the [Xabaril](https://github.com/xabaril) group, I am focused right now in two OSS projects of my own:

* TVision2: A netstandard library to build cross-platform TUI applications **and games!** using .NET Core. 
* Arrow.Sharp: A small library to bring some functional constructions and paradigms to C#

Usually I work with Microsoft technologies (netcore, Azure) and cloud-native related technologies (kubernetes, docker). But I also have some fun with Go, Rust, Elixir and Kotlin when I can!

I am a regular speaker in community events and also a beer drinker and crafter, always available to drink a craft beer!🍺
